    "\n",
    "- Uses an **elegant syntax**, making the programs you write easier to read.\n",
    "- Is an easy-to-use language that makes it simple to get your program working. This makes Python **ideal for prototype** development and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without compromising maintainability.\n",
    "- Comes with a **large standard library** that supports many common programming tasks such as connecting to web servers, searching text with regular expressions, reading and modifying files.\n",
    "- Python's **interactive mode** makes it easy to test short snippets of code. There's also a bundled development environment called IDLE.\n",
    "- Is **easily extended by** adding new modules implemented in a compiled language such as **C or C++**.\n",
    "- Can also be embedded into an application to provide a programmable interface.\n",
    "- **Runs anywhere**, including Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and Unix, with unofficial builds also available for Android and iOS.\n",
    "- Is **free** software in two senses. It doesn't cost anything to download or use Python, or to include it in your application. Python can also be freely modified and re-distributed because while the language is copyrighted it's available under an open-source license."

    "## Some programming-language features of Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A variety of basic data types are available: numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers), strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, and dictionaries.\n",
    "- Python supports object-oriented programming with classes and multiple inheritances.\n",
    "- Code can be grouped into modules and packages.\n",
    "- The language supports raising and catching exceptions, resulting in cleaner error handling.\n",
    "- Data types are strongly and dynamically typed. Mixing incompatible types (e.g. attempting to add a string and a number) causes an exception to be raised, so errors are caught sooner.\n",
    "- Python contains advanced programming features such as generators and list comprehensions.\n",
    "- Python's automatic memory management frees you from having to manually allocate and free memory in your code."
